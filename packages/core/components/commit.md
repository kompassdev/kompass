#### Message Format
- Use this format when the change has more than one meaningful theme:

```text
type: summary

- grouped change
- grouped change
```

- Use a conventional type such as `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, or `docs`, and keep the subject under 72 characters
- Add one short body bullet per meaningful change theme; use a subject-only message when there is only one self-explanatory theme

#### Commit Phase
1. Treat the file set in `<changes>` as the complete intended commit scope
2. Stage exactly that file set, including intended deletions, without staging paths outside `<changes>`
3. Compare the staged paths with `<changes>` and resolve any missing or extra path before committing
4. Generate `<commit-message>` from the loaded change themes, preserving the blank line between subject and body
5. Create the commit and store the resulting hash as `<hash>` only after it succeeds
6. If the commit fails, inspect repository status, fix the cause when safe, or STOP with the exact blocker
